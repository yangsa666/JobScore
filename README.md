# JobScore — 职位评分器 (Static)

Lightweight static web app to score job offers by salary, hours, commute and career factors.

How to open

- Open `index.html` in a browser. On Windows you can double-click the file or run:

```powershell
start .\index.html
```

What changed

- Extracted styles to `css/style.css` and JS to `js/app.js`.
- Reworked layout to use Bootstrap for responsiveness.

Next steps (optional)

- Add unit tests for the scoring logic (node + jest).
- Add export/import presets.
